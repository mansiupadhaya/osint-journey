# My OSINT Journey

Welcome to my OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) walkthrough repository! 
This space is a growing collection of hands-on writeups, notes, and reflections from various OSINT challenges and investigations I've taken on.

Each file represents a different task, platform, or technique I've explored, all written from my perspective 
as I learn, experiment, and build up my skills. 

### ðŸ“Œ What you'll find here:
- Step-by-step walkthroughs of challenges I've completed
- My process for analysing images, verifying details, and tracing digital clues
- Screenshots, tool breakdowns, and my thought process along the way
- A list of the resources/tools I'll be using for every challenge

### ðŸ“š Why I made this repo:
This repo is part of my self-learning initiative in open-source intelligence, an area I'm genuinely curious about and actively trying to improve in. Whether you're just starting out, casually exploring, or knee-deep in your own OSINT path, I hope you find somethng here useful or insightful.

Feel free to explore the files on here, follow along, or even try the same challenges for yourself.

Thanks for stopping by!
